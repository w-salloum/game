# Game
When a player starts, it incepts a random (whole) number and sends it to the second 
player as an approach of starting the game. The receiving player can now always choose 
between adding one of {-1, 0, 1} to get to a number that is divisible by 3. Divide it by three. The 
resulting whole number is then sent back to the original sender.
